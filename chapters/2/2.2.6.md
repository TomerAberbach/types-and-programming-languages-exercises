**Proof:** *R'* is the reflexive closure of *R*.

In order for *R'* to be the reflexive closure of *R*, it must satisfy the following conditions:

1. It is reflexive.
2. It contains *R*.
3. It is the smallest set satisfying the preceding conditions.

The smallest reflexive relation is {(*s*, *s*) | *s* in *S*}. The smallest set containing *R* is *R*. Since *R'* is the union of the smallest reflexive relation and the smallest set containing *R*, it must be the smallest reflexive set containing *R*.

Therefore, *R'* is the reflexive closure of *R*.
