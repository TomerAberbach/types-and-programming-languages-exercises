**Proof:** *R^+* is the transitive closure of *R*.

In order for *R^+* to be the transitive closure of *R*, it must satisfy the following conditions:

1. It is transitive.
2. It contains *R*.
3. It is the smallest set satisfying the preceding conditions.

Suppose that some set *A* is a transitive relation containing *R*.

*R_0* is a subset of *A* because *R_0* is *R*, which *A* contains.

Suppose that *R_j* is a subset of *A* for some *j* >= 0. Since *R_j* is a subset of *A* and *A* is transitive, *A* must contain all (*s*, *u*) where *t*, (*s*, *t*), (*t*, *u*) are in *R_j*. Therefore, B = {(*s*, *u*) | *t* in *S*, (*s*, *t*), (*t*, *u*) in *R_j*} is a subset of *A*. Since *R_(j + 1)* is the union of *R_j*, a subset of *A*, and *B*, also a subset of *A*, it is a subset *A*.

Therefore, for all *i* >=0, *R_i* is subset of *A* and since *R^+* is the union of these sets, it is also a subset of *A*. It then follows that *R^+* is the smallest transitive relation containing *R* and, equivalently, the transitive closure of *R*.
