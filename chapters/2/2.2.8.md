**Proof:** *P* is preserved by *R^**.

In order for *P* to be preserved by *R^**, *P*(*s'*) must be true whenever (*s*, *s'*) is in *R^** and *P*(*s*) is true.

Suppose (*s*, *s'*) is in *R^** and *P*(*s*) is true. Since *R^** is the smallest reflexive and transitive relation containing *R*, we can complete the proof by structural induction on (*s*, *s'*):

1. (*s*, *s'*) is in *R*: Since *P* is preserved by *R* and *P*(*s*) is true, *P*(*s'*) is true.

2. *s* = *s'*: Since *P*(*s*) is true and *s* = *s'*, *P*(*s'*) is true.

3. There exist some (*s*, *t*), (*t*, *s'*) in *R^** : Since *P*(*s*) is true, by the induction hypothesis, *P*(*t*) is true. Again, by the induction hypothesis, since *P*(*t*) is true, *P*(*s'*) is true.

Therefore, *P* is preserved by *R^**.
